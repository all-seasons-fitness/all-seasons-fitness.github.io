All Seasons Fitness was created to give people a place to move, connect, and get stronger — without the pressure to shrink, "bounce back" or show up looking perfectly put together.

Our classes combine strength training, cardio, and core in a way that’s challenging but always adaptable. Whether you're pregnant, postpartum, starting fresh, or deep into your fitness journey, you'll find workouts that support your goals and a community that cheers you on. Kids are welcome. Modifications are always offered. And showing up imperfectly is more than enough.

Classes are held outdoors in Mountlake Terrace during the spring/summer months, and indoors in Downtown Edmonds when the weather turns cold.
