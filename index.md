All Seasons Fitness provides strength-based conditioning workouts in a non-intimidating, kid-friendly, community-driven environment. Classes are located in the Mountlake Terrace / Edmonds WA area.

Who are these classes for? Anyone and everyone! They're designed for an intermediate level, but beginners are absolutely welcome and everything can be scaled. Kids are always welcome but not required either — you don’t have to be a parent to join!

**Length**: 1 hour

**Structure**: 10 min warm-up, 32–40 min workout, short cool-down & stretch, lean-up, mingle, hang out if you’d like

**Focus**: Functional strength (with extra glute & back work as we could all use some more of that!)

**Style**: Strength-based conditioning — not just chasing a sweat to burn calories

**Equipment**: We keep it simple so you’re not lugging too much gear

**Environment**: Non-intimidating, kid-friendly, community-driven

**Vibe**: Work hard, build community and support each other wherever we're at
