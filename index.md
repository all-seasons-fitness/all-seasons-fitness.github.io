title: All Seasons Fitness

All Seasons Fitness was created to give people a place to move, connect, and get stronger —without the pressure to shrink, "bounce back" or show up looking perfectly put together.

Our classes combine strength training, cardio, and core in a way that’s challenging but always adaptable. Whether you're pregnant, postpartum, starting fresh, or deep into your fitness journey, you'll find workouts that support your goals and a community that cheers you on. Kids are welcome. Modifications are always offered. And showing up imperfectly is more than enough.

Classes are held outdoors in Mountlake Terrace during the spring/summer months, and indoors in Downtown Edmonds when the weather turns cold.

**Length**: 1 hour

**Structure**: 10 min warm-up, 32–40 min workout, short cool-down & stretch, lean-up, mingle, hang out if you’d like

**Focus**: Functional strength (with extra glute & back work as we could all use some more of that!)

**Style**: Strength-based conditioning — not just chasing a sweat to burn calories

**Equipment**: We keep it simple so you’re not lugging too much gear

**Environment**: Non-intimidating, kid-friendly, community-driven

**Vibe**: Work hard, build community and support each other wherever we're at
