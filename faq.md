# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

**Do I need to be in shape before I join?**

<img class="img-responsive asf-img asf-img-small pull-right" src="assets/images/inside1.png">

Not at all! Every class is designed with options for all fitness levels — from brand-new beginners to experienced athletes. You’ll always be encouraged to move at your pace, and this is a crew of people who get it — wherever you’re at.

**Am I too old/too young to join?**

Not at all. Our community ranges from late 20s to late 60s, with a mix of fitness levels and life stages. Everyone moves at their own pace, and the variety makes class more fun and welcoming.

**Can men join All Seasons Fitness?**

Absolutely! Our classes are designed for all adults, regardless of gender. We welcome everyone who wants to get stronger, move more, and be part of a supportive community.

**I’m pregnant / postpartum — can I still join?**

Absolutely. Many of our members are prenatal or postpartum, and workouts are easily adjusted to meet your needs. Just let your coach know at the start of class.

**What if I need modifications?**

No problem! Every workout can be adjusted for injuries, pregnancy, postpartum needs, or whenever you're having an off day. 

## Class Details

**How long are classes?**

Each class runs about 60 minutes, including warm-up, strength work, conditioning, and cool down.

**Where are classes held?**

We're outdoors in Mountlake Terrace for part of the year, indoors at the Masonic Center in Downtown Edmonds for the rest. The exact spots are easy to find, and we’ll give you directions when you sign up.

**Do I need to sign up ahead of time?**

Yes, please do! It helps us plan class and make sure equipment is ready for you. Reserve your spot on the <a href="https://allseasonsfitness.as.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All Seasons Fitness Acuity website</a>.

## Family-Friendly

**Can I bring my kids?**

Yes! All Seasons Fitness is family-friendly and while kids aren't a part of the workout they are always welcome to tag along while you move.

**What do my kids do during class?**

It depends on your kiddo! Some play with others, some will stay next to you and try to climb all over you every chance they get. Sometimes the goal is just getting out of the house and getting some movement in. Bring snacks, toys, or whatever keeps them happy. If you need to nurse or step aside for a moment, that’s okay too!
