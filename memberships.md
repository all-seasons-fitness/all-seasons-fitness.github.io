# Membership Options

Your [first class](/first-class.html) is $10! After that, per-class prices vary depending on what option you go for, and whether or not you'll bring your own weights. 

There are options to buy single classes (drop-ins), 10-20 class packs, and monthly subscriptions. Cash preferred - use the "pay later" option.
