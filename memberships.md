# Membership Options

No start up costs. No long cancellation windows. No pressure. Just options that fit your life.

Your [first class](/first-class.html) is $10! After that, per-class prices vary depending on what option you go for, and whether or not you'll bring your own weights. 

Choose from:

- **4x/month** $55 – A great option to keep you accountable for once a week.
- **8x/month** $100 – 2 days of strength training/week is the minimum goal for our bodies. This will get you there!
- **Unlimited** $125 – Show up as often as you want... maximum gains!

Want to keep things even more flexible?

- **10-Class Pack** $150 or **20-Class Pack** $280 – Both good for 6 months
- **Drop-Ins** $17 – Jump in whenever it works for you!

Memberships renew monthly and can be canceled or changed anytime. You're in control.
