"I had been doing HIIT classes for a long time but felt like my body just couldn't keep up with the high intensity anymore. I was looking for something lower intensity, but everything I tried didn't feel like a real workout. Enter All Seasons Fitness. The strength-focused workouts get my heart rate up, challenge me, and most importantly I leave feeling accomplished every single time." — Katie Q.
