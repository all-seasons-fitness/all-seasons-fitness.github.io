**Warm-Up:** We start together with a guided warm-up to get your body ready.

**Workout:** The main workout combines strength and conditioning. Your coach will demonstrate the movements, offer options, watch your form and help you adjust as needed.

**Cool Down:** We finish with a short cool down and stretch, plus a few minutes to connect before heading out.

"I started going to classes when I was about 7 weeks postpartum and I am still going a couple times a week 2 years later. I love that I'm able to get a great workout and my kids have fun playing with other kids. Brittany is knowledgeable about how to workout correctly to avoid injury and she is always able to offer modifications if something doesn't feel quite right." — Annie P.
