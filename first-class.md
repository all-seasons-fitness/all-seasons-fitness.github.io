# What These Classes Are All About

**Focus**: Functional strength (with extra glute & back work as we could all use some more of that!)

**Style**: Strength-based conditioning — not just chasing a sweat to burn calories

**Equipment**: We keep it simple so you’re not lugging too much gear

**Environment**: Non-intimidating, kid-friendly, community-driven

**Vibe**: Work hard, build community and support each other wherever we're at

# Class Format

**Length**: 1 hour

**Structure**: 10 min warm-up, 32–40 min workout, short cool-down & stretch, lean-up, mingle, hang out if you’d like

# Who Are These Classes For?

Anyone and everyone! I program for an intermediate level, but beginners are absolutely welcome and everything can be scaled.

Kids are always welcome but not required either — you don’t have to be a parent to join!
