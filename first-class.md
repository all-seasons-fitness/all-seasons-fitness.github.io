# Your First Class at All Seasons Fitness

## How to Prepare

Wear comfortable workout clothes and athletic shoes.

Bring water and a mat (a yoga mat, towel, or outdoor blanket all work).

Kids are welcome — bring snacks, toys, or whatever helps them stay comfortable.

All equipment is provided for your first class.

## What Happens in Class

**Warm-Up:** We start together with a guided warm-up to get your body ready.

**Workout:** The main workout combines strength and conditioning. Your coach will demonstrate the movements, offers options, watch your form and help you adjust as needed.

**Cool Down:** We finish with a short cool down and stretch, plus a few minutes to connect before heading out.

## What We Ask of You

Please arrive 10 minutes early so we can get you set up and ready to go.

Let your coach know about any injuries, pregnancy, or postpartum considerations.

Move at your own pace and take rest as needed.
